# Instructions to run the scrape_indeed.py file

1. The scraping uses selenium (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) for dynamic scraping
2. There is the issue of the site (indeed.com) rate limiting bots from scraping. Hence it is quite hard to scrape 5000 jobs. Hence be prepared to prove that you are a human to the site (multiple times during the scraping process)!
3. To run simply type python scrape_indeed.py 



# Instructions to run the classifier
1. The format to run the classifier is python classify_job.py test_file.csv

You have to provide a test file with only job descriptions. The code will first train a classifier (SVM classifier) using the scraped data. It is a binary classifier since there are two classes (Data Scientist & Software Engineer). Then it will print the 5-fold cross validation score on the training data. It will also write the predictions on the test data to a file named test_predictions.csv.
